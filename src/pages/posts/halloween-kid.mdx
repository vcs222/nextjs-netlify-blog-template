Although my son is comfortable when I photograph him, he rarely asks me to take photos.

This Halloween was different, he painted his face and asked me to take some shots of him.
He literary started acting, playing, singing, and screaming like a zombie.

I have to tell you, it was a very special moment for me to witness such a clear act of sharing his joy and maybe even his inner demons.

Love you kiddo ❤️
