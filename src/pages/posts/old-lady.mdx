Connecting with strangers is not easy, especially when you feel that you need to make it work somehow.
When I met this old lady in a bus station in Gothenburg it was the exact opposite. It felt so natural
like connecting with my grandmother when I was a kid. I instantly felt the chemistry in the way she
smiled at me and the way I smiled back at her. At that moment I felt confident to turn on my camera
and take a waist-level shot to save this special moment.
